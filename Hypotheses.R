#  --- Variables --- # 

# Response variable
  #"estimate": Slope of the population (species*site) abundance (sindex) temporal trends (temporal series >= 10 years with positive values of at least half of the years) considering temporal autocorrelation.
    # Structure of the linear model to calculate estimates (see "Butterfly population trends.R"): log(sindex + 1) ~ year, correlation = corAR1(form = ~ year)

# Main predictor
  #"urb_trend": Slope of the temporal trend of urbanization (built-up fraction) at site level associated to a specific temporal series (species*site combination).
    # urb_trends are calculated at 4 different scales: 100*100m; 500*500m; 1000*1000m; and 2000*2000m. All models will be replicated at these four scales to test variability in model results.
    # To calculate urb_trends we followed the following process (see "urbanization trends.R" lines 75-168): 
      #1. Modeling urbanization from 1975 to 2025, with available data at intervals of 5 years, using four different model types: linear; polynomial, exponential and logarithmic.
      #2. Select the model with the lowest AIC and predict the urbanization for the years corresponding to the species*site temporal series: 99.3% exponential; 0.7% linear.
      #3. Calculate the linear slope for the subset of years. *If the best model in step 2 was the linear model, then slope of 1975-2025 will be equal to the slope for the subset years.

# Random factors
  #1. "SPECIES": Unique species (n = 145).
  #2. "SITE_ID: Unique sites (i.e. transect locations) (n = 1137).
  #3. "genzname": Climate region classification following Metzger et al.2013.
    #Rclim levels: Cold and wet (0.12%); Cold and mesic (28.34%); Cool temperate and dry (10.1%); Cool temperate and xeric (0.52%); Cool temperate and moist (22.3%); Warm temperate and mesix (34.7%); Warm temperate and xeric (3.9%).

# Covariables (could also be included as random factors)
  #1."urban_name": Site type based on urbanization (considering both population number and built-up fraction) at the start of the temporal series (see "urbanization trends.R" lines 230-294)
    # Only in 14.6% species*site cases a site change the urban_name category over the temporal series.
    # Urban name levels: Urban center (3.35%); Dense urban (1.27%); Semi-dense urban (0.61%); suburban/peri-urban (7.9%); rural (1.6%); low density rural (14.8%); very low density rural (70.5%)
    # * Data biased towards rural sites.
    # Maybe create a new factor with only two levels (urban vs. rural)

# Species traits interacting with urbanization trends
  #1. "HSI": Quantitative measure of hostplant specialization (Middleton-Weeling et al. 2020). ---> TROPHIC SPECIALIZATION
  # Hostplant index ranges from 0 for species which are highly polyphagous to 1 for species that are completely monophagous.  
    #Other possible variables measuring trophic specialization: Number of adult food types (1-8: herbs, ergot, shrub/tree flower, honeydew, sap, decaying plant, animal, mineral)
  #2. "WIn": Wing index. Composite variable representing a single measurement of overall size generated from forewing length and wingspan measures (Middleton-Weeling et al. 2020). ---> MOBILITY
  #3 "temp.mean". The mean temperature within the species range (Schweiger et al. 2014) ---> CLIMATE NICHE POSITION
    #Consider using temp.max/temp.min depending on the hypotheses ---> Upper/Lower climatic limit
  #4. "temp.sd". Standard deviation of temperature across the species range (Schweiger et al. 2014) ---> CLIMATE NICHE BREADTH
    # Alternatively "range.ann.temp": annual range in monthly temperature (warmest month - coldest month) or 
  #5."FMo_Average": Average number of months of the year a species is observed flying as a proxy of voltinism.*In Callaghan et al. 2021 FMo_Average is considered a proxy of thermal tolerance.

# Climate trends
    # Slope of the temporal trend of each climate variable at site level associated to a specific temporal series (species*site combination).
      # "bio1": Mean annual temperature
      # "bio4": Temperature seasonality
      # "bio12": Mean annual precipitation
      # "bio15": Precipitation seasonality
      # "GDD5": Degree-days above 5Â°C, growing degree-days
      # "DMA": 	De Martonne aridity index. (Mean annual precip.)/(Mean annual temp. + Mean temperature of the warmest quarter) + 12*Precipitation of the driest month/(Mean temperature of the driest month)) / 2

#Weights: Logarithm of the inverse of the variance (log(1/std.error)). Trends with higher precision are weighted more heavily than those with greater uncertainty.
